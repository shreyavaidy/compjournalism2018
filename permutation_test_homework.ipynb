    "# Assignment 5: Permutation Tests\n",
    "Frontiers of Computational Journalism Fall 2018, Columbia Journalism School\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will compute a one-tailed difference of means p-value by using a permutation test. This is a classic statistical problem the comes up in many different scenarios when comparing two groups. Examples include testing medications between treatment and control groups of patients, or testing an intervention like a different teaching method in two different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't really recommend using p-values, or statistical significance testing in general -- I'd prefer to see these types of results reported as confidence intervals on the effect sizes. However, a great deal of research used and still uses p-values, so it's important that you understand what they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally this sort of p-value would be computed by using something like a t-test. I want you to do it using a permutation test because I think it's conceptually clearer. Also, randomization methods are cool, and often a lot simpler and more powerful than classicial analytic methods.\n",
